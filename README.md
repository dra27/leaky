# Using memtrace on Windows

Demonstration repository for using memtrace effectively on Windows.

This is a companion to my [blog post](http://www.dra27.uk/blog/platform/2020/10/08/windows-memtrace.html) which complements Jane Streetâ€™s [original blog post](https://blog.janestreet.com/finding-memory-leaks-with-memtrace/).

## Instructions

- Prepare OCaml 4.11.1 on any of the four native Windows ports and ensure `Path` correctly set
- Initialise the submodules

```
cd vendor\dune-repo
ocaml bootstrap.ml
cd ..\..
vendor\dune-repo\dune build vendor\memtrace_viewer_with_deps\client\main.bc
set MEMTRACE=js_of_ocaml.ctf
vendor\dune-repo\dune exec -- js_of_ocaml.exe compile -o foo.js _build\default\vendor\memtrace_viewer_with_deps\client\main.bc
```
